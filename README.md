Valuable Immolation Prevention Ropes - An open system for suppressing electrical fires

Inspired by a recent post on the Prusa facebook group, I got to thinking about fire suppression for 3D Printers, but this system could be applicable to any devices that could a) catch on fire and b) run on electricity.

The basic idea is this:
1) A fire supression agent is stored in a pressurised tank
2) The tank is connect to a series of tubes which will melt and release the agent at a certain temperature
3) The whole system is monitored by a pressure gauge to ensure it is pressurised
4) The system also has a pressurised switch which should cut power to all devices when the agent is released

This system should be effective, cheap, low maintenance, user servicable, and should use off the shelf and widely available componenets wherever possible.

Possible Agents (need to determine availability):
1) CO2
2) HFC-227ea

Possible Tube Materials (nened to determine pressure ratings, melting points, availability):
1) Nylon
2) PVC

Other questions to answer:
1) Pressure switch to cut power - GCFI?
2) "Smart" Gauge and/or Pressure Switch to send alerts?
3) Can sections of tube be connect with metal or other couplings to make them easily replacable or allow for easier mounting, T-junctions, etc. Makes the system modular (ie. enclosures could "stand alone" and be connected to existing ensclosures by connect fittings of different enclosures.
